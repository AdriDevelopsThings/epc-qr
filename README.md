# epc-qr
A next.js app to generate a EPC (European Payments Council) QR code to transmit SEPA payment information.

## Usage
Run this next.js yourself or use a hosted instance like [this](https://epc.adridoesthings.com). Then just insert your payment information and a qr code will get generated automatically. Of course your data will not be transmitted to the server.
